{"google":"","body":"# Welcome to Translate-It!\r\n\r\nThis is a localization (aka L10n) project, to help you translate your applications and websites.\r\n\r\nThe process is quite simple: 1. The developers import their string resource files, with the text in one language. 2. The translators have access to these resources and can display side by side the original text and its translation. 3. When the translations are done, it is possible to export them in various file formats (depending on your project needs). This export can be automated to be included in scripts.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Support multiple projects\r\n* Users can be administrators or translators.\r\n* Export in iOS property files, Java property files, JSON objects.\r\n* Import from CSV\r\n* Zipped output from a simple URL call to automate the update of the application packages.\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\nThis project has been design for fast and simple deployment.\r\n\r\n* The server side is in Java and targets Google App Engine. You have to get a Google account to deploy it, but it can perfectly run on a free account without reaching the limits. It uses several Google features, such as the database and the Google authentication for sign-in.\r\n* The UI part is made in Flex. A compiled version of the SWF file is included in the server.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nThis project has just been released as open-source, there is a lot of work to do:\r\n* Support more import/export format\r\n* Add security to prevent package downloads by an unauthorized person.\r\n* Switch from Flex to HTML5 (?)","tagline":"Documentation pages for translate-it","note":"Don't delete this file!
